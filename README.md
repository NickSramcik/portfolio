# Portfolio

This web application is my personal portpfolio, featuring some projects I'm currently working on, and a small about me page.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This web application is style via flexbox, and is navigable with basic javascript. It uses media queries to be responsive to any screen size. 

## Optimizations

The contact form doesn't currently work correctly, it needs to be connected to my email on the back end. I'd also like to change the image previews to animated gifs, so they can display more of each website. 

## Lessons Learned:

This portfolio page has been challenging for me, because I feel nervous publishing a portfolio that isn't absolutely perfect. Biggest lesson here is not to let perfect be the enemy of good, and that a website with flaws is better than an unpublished website!
